## Apps with python (KIVY)

The follwowing screenshots are from a window opening in my terminal when the python code is run. As can be noted the program itself runs like an app simulating a battle between two pokemon input by the user. Each pokemon corresponds to an api end point from: https://pokeapi.co. Each input must correspond to a pokemon listed consequently outputing the kind of attacks used by that pokemon in the api database and detracting from its health (also listed on the database) with each subsequent attack. A popup with open to show the winner of the round, and ascrollable battle log is also available. With linux this could be developed very easily into a downloadable form of app however ability to do this using mac is limited to the size of available storage that could be attributed to running a partition. <a href= "https://github.com/LaurenG123/Training/blob/main/running_pokecode.py">Try the pokemon game code.

The only requirement for running the code is to have kivy installed. You can do this through the Pycharm terminal:



		pip install kivy

The program also implements a try and except clause to mitigate and problems that may arise if a pokemon that does not correspond to one existing in the database is input by the user. Also note that the program admits input in either lower or uppercase... or a mixture of both!!

*Updates to be released: downloadable csv file of battle log*
*Could be improved: the build could be contained in a .kv file instead of as a function in main*
